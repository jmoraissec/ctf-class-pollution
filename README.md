# ctf-class-pollution
An open source CTF challenge for practicing class pollution in Python.

Inspired by [Abdulrah33m's Blog post](https://blog.abdulrah33m.com/prototype-pollution-in-python/).

Just run the app.py flask application. If you want to use Docker try
```
docker build -t app .
docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:80:8081 app
```
